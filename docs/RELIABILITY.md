# Reliability

Reliability expectations and practices for this project.

## Health Checks

- `GET /health` verifies B2 connectivity and returns `healthy` or `degraded`
- Health endpoint is always available, even when B2 is down

## Error Handling

- HTTP handlers return structured error responses with appropriate status codes
- External service failures (B2) are caught and surfaced as 500/503 responses
- No unhandled exceptions leak stack traces to clients
- Uncaught exceptions are converted to a typed JSON 500 (`{"detail": "Internal server error"}`, modeled by `app.types.ErrorResponse`) by the catch-all in `timing_middleware`
- **Error responses carry CORS headers.** `CORSMiddleware` is registered LAST in `main.py` so it is the outermost middleware and wraps every response — including uncaught-exception 500s produced by the inner catch-all. This is intentional and load-bearing: if a 500 shipped without `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, the browser would block it and the frontend would surface only an opaque "network error", hiding the real server bug. Regression-guarded by `tests/test_error_handling.py::test_unhandled_exception_500_carries_cors_headers`.

## Logging

- Structured JSON logging via Python stdlib
- Every request gets a `request_id` for tracing
- Log levels: ERROR for failures, WARNING for degraded state, INFO for requests

## Observability

- Request timing middleware logs duration for every request
- `/metrics` endpoint exposes basic Prometheus-format counters
- Upload success/failure counts tracked

## Stateful Counters — durability caveats

The download counter and the `/metrics` counters are **in-process, per replica**. Consequences to plan for before scaling:

- **Download counter** (`app/repo/counter.py`) persists to a JSON file at `DOWNLOAD_COUNT_FILE` (default `data/download_count.json`). On an ephemeral filesystem (Railway without a mounted volume) it **resets to 0 on every redeploy**. With multiple replicas each keeps its own file/count. For durable, shared counts: mount a persistent volume, or swap the adapter for Redis/DB.
- **`/metrics` counters** live in process memory and reset on restart. Behind a load balancer, each replica reports only its own slice — scrape with an instance label and aggregate, or push to a shared collector.

## Rate Limiting

- Per-IP fixed-window limiter (`app/runtime/ratelimit.py`); `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` / `RATE_LIMIT_WRITE_PER_MINUTE` are the budgets. Rejected requests get `429` with a `Retry-After` header.
- Counters are in-process per replica; horizontal scaling needs a shared store (e.g. Redis) for a global limit.

## Graceful Degradation

- File listing returns empty list (not error) when B2 has no objects
- A failed browser→B2 upload leaves no server state; the client surfaces the error and the row stays retryable
- Frontend shows skeleton states while loading, error states on failure

## Resource Isolation & Limits

- **Threadpool isolation**: blocking B2/file work uses Starlette's shared request
  threadpool, but AI generation (which can hang on a slow provider past its
  deadline, leaking an unkillable thread) runs on a *dedicated* bounded
  `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`GENERATION_MAX_CONCURRENCY`) so those leaks can never
  starve file I/O or `/health`.
- **Body size**: an ASGI middleware caps request bodies at `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_SIZE`
  (`413`) before they are buffered — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#request-body-size-limit).
- **Upload memory**: file bytes **never transit the API**. The browser PUTs them
  straight to B2 via a presigned URL (`/upload/presign` → PUT → `/upload/complete`),
  so no endpoint buffers an upload body — the only server-side upload I/O is the
  `head_object` + a 32-byte Range GET at finalize. This is why `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_SIZE`
  is now a tight ~1 MB cap (every route takes only small JSON control payloads);
  there is no per-upload memory bound to tune. Trade-off: the true-size and
  magic-byte checks run at `/upload/complete`, so an object a client PUTs but never
  finalizes is unvalidated — see the unconfirmed-object caveat in
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#file-surface-authentication--per-user-isolation).
- **Backblaze client**: explicit connect/read timeouts, capped retries, and a
  connection pool sized to the request threadpool, so a hung B2 endpoint fails
  fast instead of tying up threads.
- **Per-user listing cache**: `list_all_objects` (`repo/b2_listing.py`) caches all
  prefixes (30s TTL, size-capped, single-flight, invalidated on any
  upload/delete/finalize) so a dashboard load doesn't re-scan a user's prefixes on
  every request.

## Deployment

- Build/start command, `/health` (API) or `/signin` (web) healthcheck, and
  `ON_FAILURE` restart policy are codified per service in `railway.json`.
- Zero-downtime deploys via rolling updates.
- Reproducible builds: exact-pinned `requirements.txt` (API) and
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (web).
- Environment-specific configuration via env vars (no config files in prod).
- `/health` returns `200` even when B2 is unreachable (body reports
  `degraded`) — B2 is a shared downstream dependency, so a `503` would restart
  otherwise-healthy instances during a B2 outage without helping.
