"""Auth business logic: turn a raw access token into a validated AuthUser.

Identity (who a token belongs to) is served from a short-TTL cache to drop one
of the two Supabase round-trips an authenticated request otherwise makes. The
role/authorization decision is NEVER cached — it is fetched live on every
request, so a demoted admin loses access immediately (no privilege-escalation
window). See docs/SECURITY.md (Authentication & Authorization).
