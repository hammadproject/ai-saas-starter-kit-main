"""Tests for the shared, pooled Supabase httpx client.

These prove the pooling contract that replaced the per-call
`async with httpx.AsyncClient(...)`: one client instance is reused across repo
calls, it is closed idempotently on shutdown, it is lazily recreated when the
lifespan never ran (the test-drive path), and auth still 401s on a bad token
end-to-end through the pooled client.
